# dotfiles

My setup for Linux hosts - there are many dotfiles projects, but this one is
mine.

## Setup

We need a few dependencies prior to starting:
- git
- tig
- wget
- fontconfig
- zip

## Install dependencies and run

Fire up a shell and run

```console
> git clone git@github.com:jesserobertson/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
> cd ~/.dotfiles
> script/install
> script/bootstrap
```

Then you should be able to open a new terminal and get dropped into a nice
environment :)
